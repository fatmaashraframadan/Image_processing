# image_processing
An image processing (or photo editing) software like Photo Shop allows you to load an image (like the photographer image here) and apply some changes (called filters) to image and then save it again.

## Filter 1: Black and White Image
If you apply this function to the loaded image, it will produce another version of the image that is black and white.

## Filter 2: Invert Image
If you apply this function to the loaded image, it will produce the negative of the image and you can store it in the file name you give.The negative has every black pixel turned to white and every white pixel turned to black and every gray pixel is turned to opposite level of brightness (255 – pixel value).

## Filter 3: Merge Images
In this function, you will be asked to enter the name of another image.Then the program will load this image. The program will create a new image, with every pixel equal the average gray level of the corresponding pixels in the images to merge.

## Filter 4: Flip Image
This filter allows the user to flip the image horizontally or vertically, as if it is reflected on a mirror.

## Filter 5: Rotate Image
This filter allows the user to rotate the image clockwise by 90º, 180º or 270º as the user chooses.

## Filter 6: Darken and Lighten Image
This filter allows the user to make the image darker or lighter by 50%

## Filter 7: Detect Image Edges
This function finds the edges of the drawings in the image and turns the image into a skeleton version of the original as if it is drawn with pencil without coloring as shown.

## Filter 8: Enlarge Image
This filter allows the user to enlarge one of the four quarters of the image into a separate new image.

## Filter 9: Shrink Image
This filter allows the user to shrink the image dimensions to 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4 the original dimensions.

## Filter a: Mirror Image
This filter mirrors 1/2 of the image as seen here in order: Left 1/2, Right 1/2, Upper 1/2 and Lower 1/2.

## Filter b: Shuffle Image
Assume the image consist of 4 quarters as shown, the user enters the order he wants to the quarters in the new image. Wrong input is rejected. Assume he entered 4 3 2 1 he gets image 1. Or if he enters 3 1 4 2 he gets image 2. User can enter any order he likes.

## Filter c: Blur Image
